I am going to work on building a machine learning model, which will predict and forecast the prices of NIFTY-50 index of the Indian Stock market. In this generation, we can see that there are a lot of startups which enable you to easily invest in stocks and trade in share market. Although these start-ups make 
it easier for beginners to get started with investment in stocks, but it is almost impossible for a beginner to predict the price of the stocks.
Develop a model that will predict the price of NIFTY-50 index. The model will be trained upon past 14 years of data, which was collected from yahoo finance. 

Technologies Used:
• Python
• Jupyter Notebook
• Git & GitHub

Expected Outcomes:
• The accuracy of prediction should be more than 85%.
• The model will predict the following: 
o Open price
o Close Price
o Average Price
• After successful creation of model, develop a dashboard to present the predictions.

Future Prospects:
• The scope of this project can be expanded to forecasting the price for any given stock
